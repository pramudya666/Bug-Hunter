# Bug-Hunter

Here are some tools that I created to search for bugs on a website. Some of these tools might be good for you beginners who can become bug hunters.

**This is the function of every file I create**

*1.Bug_hunter*
This file is used to track bugs from a normal website, so it is suitable for beginners or checking very vulnerable websites.

*2.Kebocoran_data*
If this file is used to find potential data leaks that could occur through various things such as bugs or technical errors, then use this tool as best as possible.

*3.detector_database*
If this is clear from the name, yes, it's just that this tool is still under development and is not yet perfect

# How to install it and run it

This can be run on Windows and Linux too, I don't know about Mac.

Open the terminal and type
git clone https://github.com/pramudya666/Bug-Hunter.git
Then enter, after that you type
cd Bug-Hunter
Enter and type
python file_name.py
or
python3 file_name.py

# Use the tools as best you can and just report if there is something missing or an error in the script.
